      <h2>Backhand</h2>
      <p>Introducing Backhand. This mobile application solves the problem by giving students a community driven framework to share their favorite places on campus. Users can visit these spots and either up-vote, down-vote, or leave a comment with their thoughts on the location, with the best spots slowly emerging over time. Certain established entities on campus could also have the power to "sticky" their location, allowing any club or organization to quite literally "get themselves on the map.</p>
